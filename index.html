            <li>American musician Jeff Buckley was born in California. He's awesome!</li>
            <li>And not because he was born in Cali.</li>
            <li>He had really amazing voice.</li>
            <li>His music and his outstanding sinning manner impressed Matthew Bellamy, lead vocalist and guitarist of Muse.</li>
            <li>Many Muse songs are recognizable by Bellamy's use of vibrato, falsetto, and melismatic phrasing, influenced by Jeff Buckley.</li>
            <li>By the way, Muse performed in Saint-Petersburg two years ago.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I weren't there because I was in Irkutsk.</li>
            <li>This is my little sad story :(</li>
